# Deep-Learning-for-Graph-Representations
This contains my M.Tech project work and codes. Data will be provided on request

Year long project on exploring Neural Networks and Deep Learning Methods for learning graph representations.

#Overview of Work Done:
-> Unsupervised Methods: Deep Walk Algorithm, Modified DeepWalk, Streaming Implementation, Recursive Implementation and application to trajectory clustering, PPI etc
-> DFFN -> Deep FeedForward Neural Networks for learning graph representation using spectral graph theory
-> Semi-Supervised Methods: Graph label propagation, binary image segmentation and pixel wise classification
-> Fully-Supervised Methods: For label prediction and representation learning
